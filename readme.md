## Complete
1. Build prototype to transform word into art
2. Refactor to an Object Oriented solution
3. Handle input errors


## Questions
1. Input error handling is pretty basic. What is a more standard approach here? Correct implementation of try/catch, sending messages to the log and also alert the user in a helpful way.
2. My object orientation is rusty. Division of indexoo, string parser, and linifier are hazy. Should I have more objects here? Fewer?
3. How to best implement testing, especially if I know I'll ultimately be using react? I want to test my objects, the integration of objects, and this particular implementation.
